# AT THE BEGINNING THERE IS THE RING
I thought about focusing my project on an artistic proposal. There are many possibilities in drawing bezier curves. I have to limit them. My proposal will tell a story about circus (this word is in the title, isn't it). The first shape in the art of circus is the ring.

My idea is to have the shape of the ring for the main base picture. Secondly I changed blending mode with this idea : focus on circus theme. Under the circus tent, there is dark. Light comes with the mixing action of spotlights. I can find this feeling with "screen" blending mode.

```
ctx2d.globalCompositeOperation = "screen";
```

## First live action with the ring
In this project, everyone will try a circus sideshow by playing with transformations of the ring. I hope there will be many possibilities. For the moment I can do this with actions on the keyboard (video below), in this video I'm updating Step parameter and Bezier parameter, along with line width and color :

That's all for my post number 5. :->
