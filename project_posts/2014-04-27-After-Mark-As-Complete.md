# DEVART 2014 IS CLOSED
Oh no ! I am not in the top 20 short list... My DevArt prototype can be difficult to handle with only keyboard shortcuts. After submission limit date, I've made some updates. There is know a better support of screen sizes, and buttons can be clicked on screen with the same action as keyboard shortcuts.

## JPG SAVE !
If you have fun with the prototype and if you manage to build a nice image, you can also save it in JPG format! Everything works online.

That's all for my post number 10.
