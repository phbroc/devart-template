# KEYBOARD BENDING
This is my work in progress with circuit bending on computer keyboard. To do this, I have torn down a basic keyboard, and I have welded electric wire on connectors. I hope to be able to build a special computer controller with this kind of idea. At the moment there are only three switches plugged, with two positions on each of them.
