# Happy Birthday BCBC

My Bezier Curves Big Circus was sleeping somewhere during past years, but it was not out of order. I didn't want it to stay in a lazy mood for this period where I can celebrate a ten years anniversary ! To give it a new fresh energy, I decided to rewrite the source code, with a new upgrade of Dart. Dart is a pleasant language but not so easy to follow when you're coding at spare times...

## Keeping the main idea

With this overall update, I didn't wanted to brake the rules of the Circus. This application must stay not to difficult. All the initial concepts are still there :

- It's drawing a curve on html5 canvas with a three parameters trigonometric formula.
- It's using three main colors, bleending together on blackscreen with "screen" addition mode.
- It's dispatching the lines or curves on a grid with lines and columns, if wanted.
- It's elaborated to be controlled with buttons or with keyboard keys.

## Just a few new features

I have added some new features, only important ones. 

- On previous version it was not possible to save the drawing in a working file format, only the resulting image was savable. With this anniversary update, it's now downloadable in text format to keep the numeric parameters, and then this parameters can be recalled on the application to continue with the drawing.
- Playing with the style of the curve is enhanced with linecap choice, dash value, repeating colors interpollations.
- Positions on the grid can be flipped, exploded, quincunx, adding more creative variations

## More things to come later

It was a lot of work for this update. I have in mind things to modify later. I want to call back the keyboards controls. May be in the next version, I hope before the twenty years anniversary !
