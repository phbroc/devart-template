# GETTING IN TOUCH WITH GITHUB...
Well I'm not very familiar with github, and I'm trying to do my best for writing in English ! Thank's to the repository of CJ Gammon, I found some examples for building my own project for Devart. OK, let's begin with somme pictures!

## Installation
The sketch below is an idea for installation of the project

![Installation](../project_images/installation.jpg?raw=true "Installation")

The user interface could look like this : 

![User interface](../project_images/userInterface.jpg?raw=true "User interface")

My idea is to have some fun with handling many buttons. It looks like a mix table, isn't it ? User in action will stand in front of this panel, and his tuning of the system will update the screen in front of him (video projector).

![User in action](../project_images/userInAction.jpg?raw=true "User in action")

## This could be possible
My aim is to bring a wide range of action in the panel, which could lead to a wide range of visual creation.

![3 screens](../project_images/3screens.jpg?raw=true "3 screens")

That's all for my first post !
