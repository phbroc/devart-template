## Description
My project is to build a user friendly interface for mixing and blending bezier curves on screen. The code will be based on [Parametric equation](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parametric_equation) and [Bezier curves](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BÃ©zier_curve) will show the path from one point to another. I want to bring fun in this installation with many buttons and triggers. Handling them will update the curves live!

More to come...
